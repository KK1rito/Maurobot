# Maurobot

This is my oldest bot that i published like 3 years ago in a another account!
Btw, i don't think that is still working with the recent version of discord.js but i with like the v12 or v11 you can use it, it's in italian, but i will publish in the future the english version!

You can host this bot in a VPS (Home or Virtual), Heroku (How i host it) or a Personal Computer that you don't use anymore (Another good option)
